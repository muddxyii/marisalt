# Marisalt
A Dark Fantasy Pirate Role Playing Game built with Go and Ebitengine.

## About
Marisalt is a passion project that I've developed the
 concept of for several years.
It is a culmination of my most favorite games (Gothic,
 Kenshi, CK3, PZ, Software Inc.), which
includes themes of adventure, strategy, economy,
 and role-playing elements in a maritime setting.

## Project Status
**Yes**, this is a very ambitious game project, but I plan to make it easier for myself by using
very simple assets with very little animations.
